	‚Ä¢	Using AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, AutoML).
	‚Ä¢	Automating tasks using AI.
	‚Ä¢	Prompt engineering basics.
	‚Ä¢	Job market analyzer:
	‚Ä¢	Scrapes latest trends in tech hiring (based on mocked or real-time data).
	‚Ä¢	Shows most in-demand skills, certifications, and roles.
	‚Ä¢	Personalized career suggestions based on completed modules and goals.

‚∏ª

üéØ User Features:
	‚Ä¢	Login/signup system with Firebase or Supabase.
	‚Ä¢	Personalized dashboard with saved progress and certificates.
	‚Ä¢	Gamified progress system with XP, levels, and badges.
	‚Ä¢	Downloadable PDF certificates on track completion.
	‚Ä¢	Code playgrounds using web-based interpreters or code runners (like Skulpt for Python, or iframe-based REPL).

‚∏ª

üí° Bonus Features (Optional):
	‚Ä¢	Weekly AI-generated learning recommendations based on user activity.
	‚Ä¢	Study groups or chat rooms per track.
	‚Ä¢	Leaderboard for code challenges.
	‚Ä¢	Dark/light mode toggle.

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Tech Stack:
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: React + TailwindCSS
	‚Ä¢	Backend: Node.js + Express or Firebase Functions
	‚Ä¢	Database: Supabase or Firestore
	‚Ä¢	Auth: Firebase Auth or Supabase Auth
	‚Ä¢	Code Execution: Use external APIs or client-side interpreters (Skulpt, Pyodide, Monaco Editor)
	‚Ä¢	Diagramming: Integrate with libraries like react-flow, draw.io embed, or Mermaid.js

‚∏ª

üß™ Start With:
	‚Ä¢	A dashboard UI with 3 main tracks: ‚ÄúProgramming‚Äù, ‚ÄúDevOps‚Äù, ‚ÄúArchitecture‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	A sample course page for Python with:
	‚Ä¢	Embedded code editor
	‚Ä¢	Lesson content
	‚Ä¢	A quiz at the end
	‚Ä¢	A ‚ÄúJob Market Insights‚Äù mock page that lists trending skills and roles (hardcoded or API-fed)
